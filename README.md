# Group Expense Tracker
Group Expense Tracker is a Flutter group expense tracker app originally developed for my family‚Äôs use, which now I decided to make it open source. The app is designed to simplify tracking expense and enable effortless sharing of expenses among multiple users. It is available across **Android**, **iOS**, and **Web platforms**.

## [Optional] How to change the app Firebase project
#### This app depends on Firebase Auth and Firestore, so you need to add your own Firebase project as stated below
- first you may change the android and iOS package by replacing all string of `com.programmergabut.group_expense` on Android and `com.programmergabut.groupExpense` on iOS
- Create your own firebase project and register the Android, iOS, and Web
- put the `google-services.json` for Android, `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS, and `firebaseConfig` for web
- Then add your google-services.json in 
  - `android/app/google-services.json` for Android
  -  `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
  -  `lib/main.dart` in `FirebaseOptions class` for Web
- Enable Firebase Auth by email and password
- Enable Firestore and set the rules to `allow read, write: if request.auth != null;`
- Then to setup the new project you can use `flutterfire configure`, for more detail, you can check this link [Add firebase to your Flutter app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=web)
- After all the setup, then run the app smoothly ü•≥
