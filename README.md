# Group Expense Tracker
Group Expense Tracker is a Flutter group expense tracker app originally developed for my family’s use, which now I decided to make it open source. The app is designed to simplify tracking expense and enable effortless sharing of expenses among multiple users. It is available across **Android**, **iOS**, and **Web platforms**.

## How to change the app Firebase project
#### This app depends on Firebase Auth and Firestore, so you need to add your own Firebase project as stated below
- Create your own firebase project and register the Android, iOS, and Web
- open the `google-services.json` for Android, `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS, and `firebaseConfig` for web
- you can see the credential of the firebase options inside those files, you can input it to the first config firebase option screen <br>

- After all the setup, then run the app smoothly 🥳
